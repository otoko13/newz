## Viewing the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Run the app using `npm run start` from the project directory. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Run tests using `npm run test`.

## Future improvements and enhancements

As always with coding exercises, you can't do everything you'd love to. Here are a list of improvements I'd make to the design and implementation given more time:

- Alternative styling framework to office-ui-fabric - while it has a massive set of features, components and shortcuts, it's probably not the best one out there for a nice looking app. Though it does create a familiar UX for Windows users, the main reason I used it was recent familiarity with the code. 

- Responsive layout - this is massive. The current layout would not look great on a portrait mobile device of limited screen real estate. I would still have a left/right panel approach, showing only one at a time, making it easy to navigate back to the article list once an article is read.
