## Viewing the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Install necessary packages by first running `npm install` from the project directory. Run the app using `npm run start` in the same directory. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Run tests using `npm run test`.

## Future improvements and enhancements

As always with coding exercises, you can't do everything you'd love to. Here are a list of improvements I'd make to the design and implementation given more time:

- I limited the exercise to only 2 types of articles on Hacker News - jobs and stories. With more time, I would have added polls with comments to the available items. These would have to be constructed as trees to display descendents.

- Alternative styling framework to office-ui-fabric - while it has a massive set of features, components and shortcuts, it's not the best one out there for a nice looking app. Though it does create a familiar UX for Windows users, the main reason I used it was recent familiarity with the code. 

- A much nicer theme. 

- Add proper typing for all the different kinds of news items available through Hacker News.

- The method of getting news items could be much improved

- More thorough Jest testing.

- Other nice to have features:
    - Mark as unread button
    - Another filter to select between top stories, new stories and best stories
